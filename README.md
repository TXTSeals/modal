Installation Instructions
-------------------------
NOTE: Before you begins these steps make sure you have installed node.js and mongodb.
-MongoDB installation for Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMoscn8-620
-Node.js installation for Mac: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imj8PgG3bZU 

- Download the whole repository as a .zip file, then extract it (preferably on your desktop)
- Open terminal and type sudo mongod (for PC it was mongod) [DO NOT CLOSE THIS PROCESS, LEAVE IT OPEN]
- Open another terminal and cd into the 'checkin' project and type into the terminal... "node run.js"
  *If done successfully the terminal should say  "listening on 8080" and "mongoose connected"*
 -Now go into what ever browser your using (I use chrome) and go into the address bar and type "localhost:8080"
 
 If done correctly the application should display, if you have any issues send me any questions.
